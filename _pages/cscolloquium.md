<small>**Title:** Secure Database-Driven Dynamic Spectrum Sharing</small>  
<small>**Abstract**</small>  
<small>Database-driven Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) is the de facto technical paradigm approved by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for increasing wireless spectrum access by allowing unlicensed wireless devices (secondary users) with cognitive radio capabilities to have more flexible and efficient access to the radio spectrum without causing interference to licensed wireless devices (primary users). In a database-driven DSS system, a geo-location database administrator (DBA) manages secondary users' spectrum access based on the real-time spectrum availability in its service region. An effective approach to improve the spectrum-estimation accuracy in database-driven DSS systems is for the DBA to deploy a small number of dedicated spectrum sensors at strategic locations and outsources the majority of spectrum-sensing tasks to ubiquitous mobile users whereby to construct and maintain a Radio Environmental Map (REM) from periodically collected spectrum measurements. The feasibility of this approach is deeply rooted in the explosive growth in mobile devices with increasing capabilities in sensing, computation, communication, and localization. Security and privacy concerns are among the most challenging obstacles to the wide deployment of database-driven DSS systems armed with spectrum-sensing outsourcing. In this talk, I will present two case studies about the security and privacy challenges in database-driven DSS systems. Specifically, I will introduce a novel spatiotemporal approach to allow the DBA to construct an accurate REM in the presence of false spectrum measurements. Then I will present a novel private-preserving reverse auction mechanism to stimulate mobile users’ participation in crowdsourced spectrum sensing while ensuring high REM accuracy, approximate truthfulness, and differential bid privacy.</small>

<small>**Title:** Understanding Latent Correlation-Based Multiview Learning and Self-Supervision: An Identifiability Perspective</small>  
<small>**Abstract**</small>  
<small>Multiple views of data, both naturally acquired (e.g., image and audio) and artificially produced (e.g., via adding different noise to data samples), have proven useful in enhancing representation learning. Natural views are often handled by multiview analysis tools, e.g., (deep) canonical correlation analysis [(D)CCA], while the artificial ones are frequently used in self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, e.g., BYOL and Barlow Twins.  Both types of approaches often involve learning neural feature extractors such that the embeddings of data exhibit high cross-view correlations. Although intuitive, the effectiveness of correlation-based neural embedding is mostly empirically validated. This work aims to understand latent correlation maximization-based deep multiview learning from a latent component identification viewpoint. An intuitive generative model of multiview data is adopted, where the views are different nonlinear mixtures of shared and private components. Since the shared components are view/distortion-invariant, representing the data using such components is believed to reveal the identity of the samples effectively and robustly. Under this model, latent correlation maximization is shown to guarantee the extraction of the shared components across views (up to certain ambiguities). In addition, it is further shown that the private information in each view can be provably disentangled from the shared using proper regularization design. A finite sample analysis, which has been rare in nonlinear mixture identifiability study, is also presented. The theoretical results and newly designed regularization are tested on a series of tasks.<br /></small>

<small>**Title:** Rethinking Trusted Execution Environments for Embedded and IoT Systems</small>  
<small>**Abstract**</small>  
<small>Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) are offered by the CPU to keep code and data loaded inside to be protected, with respect to confidentiality and integrity, from the Rich Execution Environment (REE). TEEs can provide a haven to execute software in security and fault isolation and also serve as a trusted anchor to detect and mitigate code reuse attacks by enforcing Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) and Control-Flow Attestation (CFA) on REE software. The hardware and software of existing embedded and IoT TEEs nevertheless have the following issues, making the TEE-based solutions for isolation, CFI, and CFA either ineffective or inefficient: I1) they only provide one trusted execution environment; I2) they do not encrypt the memory, leaving them vulnerable to cold boot attacks; I3) they only provide a static and fixed hardware trusted computing base (TCB), which cannot be customized for different applications; I4) the TEE shares a processor core with the REE in a time-sliced fashion, making it vulnerable to cache side-channel attacks and undermining TEE security promises; I5) the software TCB in TEEs are large, creating big attack surfaces for run-time attacks that hijack the control or data flow; and I6) frequent context switches between the TEE and REE are very expensive, rendering CFI and CFA impractical for real-world deployment.<br /></small>
<small>It is thus imperative to rethink the design of embedded and IoT TEEs and combine existing TEEs with overlooked hardware features, such as Debug Unit (DU), for effective and efficient software attack prevention, detection and response. In this talk, I will first discuss our on-going project BYOTee, an infrastructure for building multiple customized and physically isolated TEEs with a configurable and minimal hardware and software TCB on commodity SoC FPGA devices. The customized TEEs can securely execute security-sensitive code inside them. I will also discuss our on-going project TeeCFIA, an efficient forward and backward edge CFI enforcement and attestation infrastructure with the Cortex-M TrustZone. TeeCFIA minimizes the number of context switches by utilizing debug units for tracing. TeeCFIA does not rely on instrumentation and can work on privileged programs, such as bare-metal firmware and RTOS.</small>

<small>**Title:** Low Pass Graph Signal Processing - Applications and Beyond</small>  
<small>**Abstract**</small>  
<small>As a key development in the emerging field of graph signal processing, the notion of graph filters has been used to define generative models for graph data which explains many examples of network dynamics. With this interpretation, classical signal processing tools such as frequency analysis have been applied with analogous interpretation to graph data, generating new insights for data science. In this talk, we present a "user guide" on a specific class of graph data, where the generating graph filters are low pass such that the filter attenuates contents in the higher graph frequencies while retaining contents in the lower frequencies. Our choice is motivated by the prevalence of low pass models in application domains such as social networks, financial markets, and power systems. We demonstrate how to leverage properties of low pass graph filters to learn graph topology; efficiently represent graph data through sampling, recover missing measurements; infer high level features of graph topology (such as community, centrality) when the data is imperfect, e.g., rank deficient or with missed observations. We also discuss a data-driven approach to (blindly) detect if the graph filter is indeed low pass.</small>
