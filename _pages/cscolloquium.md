<small>**Title:** Rethinking Trusted Execution Environments for Embedded and IoT Systems</small>  
<small>**Abstract**</small>  
<small>Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) are offered by the CPU to keep code and data loaded inside to be protected, with respect to confidentiality and integrity, from the Rich Execution Environment (REE). TEEs can provide a haven to execute software in security and fault isolation and also serve as a trusted anchor to detect and mitigate code reuse attacks by enforcing Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) and Control-Flow Attestation (CFA) on REE software. The hardware and software of existing embedded and IoT TEEs nevertheless have the following issues, making the TEE-based solutions for isolation, CFI, and CFA either ineffective or inefficient: I1) they only provide one trusted execution environment; I2) they do not encrypt the memory, leaving them vulnerable to cold boot attacks; I3) they only provide a static and fixed hardware trusted computing base (TCB), which cannot be customized for different applications; I4) the TEE shares a processor core with the REE in a time-sliced fashion, making it vulnerable to cache side-channel attacks and undermining TEE security promises; I5) the software TCB in TEEs are large, creating big attack surfaces for run-time attacks that hijack the control or data flow; and I6) frequent context switches between the TEE and REE are very expensive, rendering CFI and CFA impractical for real-world deployment.

It is thus imperative to rethink the design of embedded and IoT TEEs and combine existing TEEs with overlooked hardware features, such as Debug Unit (DU), for effective and efficient software attack prevention, detection and response. In this talk, I will first discuss our on-going project BYOTee, an infrastructure for building multiple customized and physically isolated TEEs with a configurable and minimal hardware and software TCB on commodity SoC FPGA devices. The customized TEEs can securely execute security-sensitive code inside them. I will also discuss our on-going project TeeCFIA, an efficient forward and backward edge CFI enforcement and attestation infrastructure with the Cortex-M TrustZone. TeeCFIA minimizes the number of context switches by utilizing debug units for tracing. TeeCFIA does not rely on instrumentation and can work on privileged programs, such as bare-metal firmware and RTOS.</small>

<small>**Title:** Low Pass Graph Signal Processing - Applications and Beyond</small>  
<small>**Abstract**</small>  
<small>As a key development in the emerging field of graph signal processing, the notion of graph filters has been used to define generative models for graph data which explains many examples of network dynamics. With this interpretation, classical signal processing tools such as frequency analysis have been applied with analogous interpretation to graph data, generating new insights for data science. In this talk, we present a "user guide" on a specific class of graph data, where the generating graph filters are low pass such that the filter attenuates contents in the higher graph frequencies while retaining contents in the lower frequencies. Our choice is motivated by the prevalence of low pass models in application domains such as social networks, financial markets, and power systems. We demonstrate how to leverage properties of low pass graph filters to learn graph topology; efficiently represent graph data through sampling, recover missing measurements; infer high level features of graph topology (such as community, centrality) when the data is imperfect, e.g., rank deficient or with missed observations. We also discuss a data-driven approach to (blindly) detect if the graph filter is indeed low pass.</small>

<small>**Title:** Highlights from MITRE’s work in cyber deception</small>  
<small>**Abstract**</small>  
<small>During the past year, our society has moved significantly from working in place to working virtually and from home. Cybersecurity becomes important not only for institutions but also for us, the end users. In this talk, Dr. Barr will share how the industry, particularly, MITRE, perceives and addresses the rapidly increasing cyber-attacks with a focus on cyber deception and Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). Specifically, the talk will include great statistics the industry learned in real attacks and defenses, and how MITRE's Engage Framework greatly enhances our ability against such attacks.</small>
