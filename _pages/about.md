<h2 id="biography"> About Ian</h2>  
I am a tenure-track assistant professor at [CS@UMass Lowell](https://www.uml.edu/sciences/computer-science/). I work on machine learning and IoT. Before joining UML, I was a postdoc at [CNSR@VT](https://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/) and obtained my Ph.D. at [CNSG@ASU](http://cnsg.asu.edu). I received my B.S. from EECS@Peking University and M.Phil from EE@The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

* We have ongoing Colloquium at CS@UMass Lowell. Check out the exciting talks [here](https://ianchen88.github.io/cscolloquium/)!

<h2 id="News"> News</h2>
* Ian is to serve as a TPC member for 2022 IEEE INFOCOM, CNS, and MASS. (Apr. 2022)
* Our paper **FLARE: Defending Federated Learning against Model Poisoning Attacks via Latent Space Representations** is accepted by ACM ASIACCS 2022 (Acceptance ratio: 18.4%). The idea is to detect model poisoning attacks on federated learning by exploring the penultimate layer representations of neural network. (Feb. 2022)
* Our paper **MANDA: On Adversarial Example Detection for Network Intrusion Detection System** is accepted by IEEE TDSC. The idea is to detect adversarial example attacks by exploring the data space. (Feb. 2022)
* Our paper **FeCo: Boosting Intrusion Detection Capability in IoT Networks via Contrastive Learning** has been accepted by IEEE INFOCOM 2022 (Acceptance ratio: 225/1129=19.9%). The idea is to use contrastive learning to learn the representation of benign traffic. (Dec. 2021)
* Ian joined CS@UML as a TTAP. (Sep. 2021)
