<h2 id="biography"> About Ian</h2>  
I am a tenure-track assistant professor at [Miner School of CIS at UMASS Lowell](https://www.uml.edu/sciences/computer-science/). I work on machine learning, security, and privacy. Before joining UMASS Lowell, I was a postdoc at [CNSR@VT](https://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/) and obtained my Ph.D. at [CNSG@ASU](http://cnsg.asu.edu). I received my B.S. from EECS@Peking University and M.Phil from EE@The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

* We have ongoing Colloquium at CS@UMass Lowell. Check out the exciting talks [here](https://ianchen88.github.io/cscolloquium/)!

<h2 id="News"> News</h2>
* Ian is to serve as a TPC member for 2024 PETs, IEEE INFOCOM and MILCOM. (Apr. 2023)
* Our paper **mmLock: User Leaving Detection against Data Theft via High-Quality mmWave Radar Imaging** is accepted by IEEE ICCCN 2023 as an invited paper. We used PointNet and Bi-LSTM to model user leaving behavior from mmWave radar signals. Congrutulation to Jiawei and other authors. (Apr. 2023)
* Our paper **DUO: Stealthy Adversarial Example Attack on Video Retrieval Systems via Frame-Pixel Search** is accepted by IEEE ICDCS 2023 (Acceptance ratio: 83/439=18.9%). We proposed a novel adversarial example attack on video retrieval models with sparse perturbations only. Congrutulation to Xin and other authors. (Apr. 2023)
* Ian is to serve as a TPC member for 2023 IEEE CNS and ICCCN. (Mar. 2023)
* Our paper **Squeezing More Utility via Adaptive Clipping on Deferentially Private Gradients in Federated Meta-Learning** is accepted by ACSAC 2022 (Acceptance ratio: 73/303=24.0%). The idea is to adapt differential privacy to address data privacy challenges in Federated Meta-Learning. Congrutulation to Ning and other authors. (Sep. 2022)
* Our paper **Clang __usercall: Towards Native Support for User Defined Calling Conventions** is accepted by ACM ESEC/FSE 2022 Demo track. The idea is to mimic popular syntax and adapting Clang for interfacing purpose of C/C++ code. Congrutulation to Jared and other authors. (Aug. 2022)
* Our paper **Transferability of Adversarial Examples in Machine Learning-based Malware Detection** is accepted by IEEE CNS 2022. The idea is to spread out adversarial perturbations in order to improve transferability of adversary example attacks. Congrutulation to Yang and other authors. (Aug. 2022)
* Ian is to serve as a TPC member for 2022 IEEE INFOCOM, CNS, and MASS. (Apr. 2022)
* Our paper **FLARE: Defending Federated Learning against Model Poisoning Attacks via Latent Space Representations** is accepted by ACM ASIACCS 2022 (Acceptance ratio: 18.4%). The idea is to detect model poisoning attacks on federated learning by exploring the penultimate layer representations of neural network. Congrutulation to Ning and other authors. (Feb. 2022)
* Our paper **MANDA: On Adversarial Example Detection for Network Intrusion Detection System** is accepted by IEEE TDSC. The idea is to detect adversarial example attacks by exploring the data space. Congrutulation to Ning and other authors. (Feb. 2022)
* Our paper **FeCo: Boosting Intrusion Detection Capability in IoT Networks via Contrastive Learning** has been accepted by IEEE INFOCOM 2022 (Acceptance ratio: 225/1129=19.9%). The idea is to use contrastive learning to learn the representation of benign traffic. Congrutulation to Ning and other authors. (Dec. 2021)
* Ian joined CS@UMASS Lowell as an incoming TTAP. (Sep. 2021)
