<h2 id="biography"> About me ([CV](/files/IanChen_CV.pdf))</h2>  
I am a research scholar and will be a TTAP at [CS/UMass Lowell](https://www.uml.edu/sciences/computer-science/). I work on security and privacy problems for machine learning and IoT. Before joining UML, I was a postdoc at [CNSR@VT](https://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/) and obtained my Ph.D. at [CNSG@ASU](http://cnsg.asu.edu). I received my B.S. from EECS@Peking University and M.Phil from EE@The Chinese University of Hong Kong.
